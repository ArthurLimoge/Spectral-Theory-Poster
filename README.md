This focuses on operators on the Hilbert Space LÂ² - mostly on kernel integral operators and on the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics.
Its aim is to cover some basics about this specific Hilbert space and some operators that one can define on it.

I did it as part of Ari Laptev's [Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~alaptev/M1R19/talk.pdf) M1R project.
