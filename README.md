# Spectral Theory Poster (2019)

This research project focuses on operators on the Hilbert Space LÂ² - mostly on kernel integral operators and on the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics.
Its aim is to cover some basics about this specific Hilbert space and some operators one can define on it.

I did it as part of [Ari Laptev](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~alaptev/)'s __Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions__ M1R project.

The poster was made on LaTeX based on a [template by Blair J. Rossetti](https://fr.overleaf.com/latex/templates/emory-poster-template/skpfmpxjnqdh).
